%   NOTE: Exchange metabolites should normally not be removed from the model
%   when using this approach, since checkTasks/fitTasks rely on putting specific
%   constraints for each task. The INIT algorithm will remove exchange metabolites
%   if any are present. Use importModel(file,false) to import a model with

%Handle detected mets:
%Previously, this was handled by giving a bonus for secreting those metabolites,

%we merge linearly dependent reactions.
%Instead, we need to figure out which reactions either produce or take up the mets.
%We then give a bonus if any of them carry flux.
%To simplify things, we focus on reactions that produce the metabolite (since there must be one such reaction). 
%It is still a bit complicated though. In this step, we focus on identifying
%producer reactions. We further reason that the direction doesn't matter - 
%we can force one of these reactions in any direction - if it becomes a consumer, it will
%automatically force another producer on as well (otherwise we'll have a net consumption).

%reactions that have been removed in the init model except the ones that were added back. In addition, we make 
%sure that no exchange rxns are removed - they can be removed in the init model if they were linearly merged with other
%reactions that were decided to be removed from the model. We want to keep all exchange rxns to make sure the tasks can
%be performed also without manipulating the b vector in the model (which is what is done in the gap-filling).
